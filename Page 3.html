            Now for the CSS tags. A CSS tag's purpose is to add a bit of personality to your website so that it doesn't look boring and plain. Normally without any CSS the background colour would be white and the text size would be 6px (pixels(pixels are almost nano dots of light which contain red, yellow and green lights that form an image p.s. Red, green and blue can create any colour)). The first rule for using CSS tags (in my order) is to put style = before you put in the CSS code.

            This is literally the first time probably that you will ever see a table in my website that I put in freely (and I mean it for both meanings of this word)
        </p>
        <table style="padding: 5px;border: 1px solid black; background-color: aliceblue; border-collapse: collapse;
        border-spacing: 0px;">
           
        </table>
    </body>
