      <p>Video intro to coders block coming soon.</p>
      <p>Before you can enter the world of coding, you should start off by learning web design. A very basic thing but very hard to learn. But that's why we're here, to help you aspire to greater things. And for that, you need to learn the 2 basic languages that are the foundation of web design. Think of them as your training wheels. Though they are coding languages they are not thought of as programming languages. Programming languages are languages like Python, JavaScript, C#, etc. They are used in things like apps and games.</p>
      <p>The first (AND main) coding language in web design is called HTML which stands for Hypertext Markup Language. What it does is that it creates all the text you read on a website. Here's some code written in it:</p>
      <img src="./resources/images/html_structure.png" alt="Code" height="300px" width="700px">
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Now it's time for CSS. CSS is a coding language that allows you to change the looks of your website. It's basically a customizer. It's what makes this website background a color other than white, allows you to pick a specific size for your pictures and videos (normally in pixels), and much more. It is almost impossible to use a website that doesn't use it.</p>
